## Deployment Strategies & Interview Talking Points

### Serverless Architecture
- **What:** Express API runs on AWS Lambda behind API Gateway — no servers to manage
- **Why it matters:** Auto-scales from 0 to thousands of requests. Zero cost at idle. This is the modern cloud standard for small-to-medium apps.
- **Interview angle:** "I chose serverless over EC2 to eliminate server maintenance and achieve automatic horizontal scaling. Lambda's pay-per-request model means zero cost during low traffic and infinite scalability during World Cup match days."

### Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- **What:** Every AWS resource (Lambda, API Gateway, IAM roles, SSM, CloudWatch) defined in `.tf` files
- **Why it matters:** Infrastructure is reproducible, version-controlled, and reviewable in PRs — no manual "click-ops" in the AWS console.
- **Interview angle:** "I can destroy and recreate the entire production environment in under 5 minutes with `terraform apply`. This also enables my Disaster Recovery strategy — I can deploy to a secondary region by changing one variable."

### CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- **What:** Automated lint → typecheck → test → build → deploy on every push to main
- **Why it matters:** Prevents broken code from reaching production. Every merge is a production deployment.
- **Interview angle:** "My pipeline enforces quality gates before any code ships. The frontend deploys via Amplify's Git integration, and the backend deploys to Lambda through GitHub Actions — achieving continuous deployment with zero manual steps."

### Secrets Management (AWS SSM Parameter Store)
- **What:** JWT_SECRET and DATABASE_URL stored as encrypted SecureStrings in SSM, not in code or env files
- **Why it matters:** Secrets never appear in Git history, CI logs, or Lambda environment variables visible in the console.
- **Interview angle:** "I follow the principle of least privilege — Lambda's IAM role only has permission to read specific SSM parameters, and secrets are encrypted at rest with KMS."

### Blue/Green Deployment (Lambda Aliases)
- **What:** New Lambda versions deployed alongside the old one. Traffic shifts after health check passes.
- **Why it matters:** Zero-downtime deployments. Instant rollback if the new version errors.
- **Interview angle:** "I use Lambda aliases with weighted traffic shifting. If the new deployment's error rate exceeds 5%, CloudWatch alarms trigger an automatic rollback — users never see a broken API."

### Observability (CloudWatch)
- **What:** Dashboard tracking Lambda invocations, error rates, latency (p50/p95/p99), API Gateway 4xx/5xx
- **Why it matters:** You can't fix what you can't measure. Alarms notify before users notice.
- **Interview angle:** "I built a CloudWatch dashboard that gives me real-time visibility into API health. I have alarms set at 5% error rate that page me via SNS — this is the same approach used by production SRE teams."

### Load Testing (Artillery)
- **What:** Simulated traffic ramps from 1 to 100 concurrent users, documenting p50/p95/p99 latencies
- **Why it matters:** Proves the app handles real-world traffic, not just a single curl request.
- **Interview angle:** "I ran load tests simulating World Cup match-day traffic — 100 concurrent users hitting the prediction and leaderboard APIs. I documented the results and correlated them with CloudWatch metrics to identify bottlenecks."

### Disaster Recovery (Pilot Light)
- **What:** Terraform can deploy the full stack to a second AWS region. Database has point-in-time recovery.
- **Why it matters:** Shows you think about business continuity, not just happy-path development.
- **Interview angle:** "My DR strategy is Pilot Light — the secondary region has no running resources (zero cost), but I can spin up the entire stack in under 30 minutes using Terraform. My RPO is under 1 hour thanks to Neon's point-in-time recovery."
